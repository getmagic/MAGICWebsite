				<h5>Aline organized her code with five files. She has two games: Guess My Number (firstgame.html) and Catch! (secondgame.html). She has a css file for Guess My Number which is firstgame.css, but she did not need a css file for Catch! since this game did not involve any text. The index.html file connects the Guess My Number and Catch! games onto one website.</h5>
