She created folders so that if she would have a problem with (for example) the science section, she would easily be able to find where the problem was, rather than scrolling through math files and css files to find science sections. The index.html file is for linking her css, math, science, and vocabulary folders into one website. The index.html file is extremely important, for if this file does not work, the whole program would not work.</h5>
