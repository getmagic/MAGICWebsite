  <br>Start by taking the Character Quiz. <br> <br>Once you have chosen a Race and a Class, a checklist of good deeds will pop up and they will help both the environment and also keep you in shape. <br> For each checkbox, there is a type of pollution you have to focus on. <br> <br> Every time you succeed, you will get a certain number of experience points and a certain number of gold pieces, which will be totaled up in the end! <br> <br>
Once you have completed 2 out of the 3 checkboxes on the leveled checklist you are on, a trivia question will pop up, based on what Class you chose. If you answer the trivia question correctly, you will get a 100 experience points along with the points for the third checkbox and be transported to the next level, without having to finish the previous level. <br> <br> If you answer it incorrectly, a number of experince points will be deducted and as the levels progress, the trivia questions will get harder and more experience points can be lost or gained. <br> <br>
If you complete all 5 levels, and finish all of the levels, you will get be congratulated on your efforts and a reminder to be aware of helping the environment. Then, if you would like, you can play again with either the same or different character!</b></span></p>
