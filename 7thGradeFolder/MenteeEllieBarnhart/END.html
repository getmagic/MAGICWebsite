      Thank you for participating in PolluFix! You have really helped the environment and you have helped yourself.<br> <br> Good job. <br> <br>
      Now, just because you have finished your experience on PolluFix doesn't mean that you should stop caring about the environment. <br> Always be conscious about environmental and other issues around you and try to help fix them, whether that may be donating, raising awareness or, just reusing water bottles instead of buying plastic water bottles and only using them once.<br> <br> <br> And remember, you can always do PolluFix again!
