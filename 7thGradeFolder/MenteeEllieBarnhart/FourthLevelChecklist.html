    <p> In previous levels, you have been focusing on the health of others and the health of the World. In this level, you will 
 focus on the health of you. Being healthy is essential to how you function. If you don't sleep enough, you won't feel well the next
 morning. If you don't eat well, you will be unhealthy.
 A manager for an important business has noticed your services and decided to thank you by paying you to feel healthy. He is willing 
 to pay you 400 gold pieces for every checkbox you complete or if you complete two checkboxes and correctly answer a Trivia 
 question. You have an chance to win 1,200 gold pieces if you complete everything. </p>
