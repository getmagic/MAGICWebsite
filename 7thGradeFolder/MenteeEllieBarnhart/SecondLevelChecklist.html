    <p>In this level, we will be focusing on electrical pollution and the effects of it. Electrical 
 pollution can cause many devastating things to happen to the environment. For example, the burning of fossil fuels can emit many 
 unhealthy gases into the air and traps some of the gases that would usually go into space and thus, traps the Sun's heat and 
 makes the planet feel warmer.
 A shopkeeper has been complaining of the smell of too much exhaust around his shop and making the air hard to breathe. He wants you 
 to complete a checklist that will help the exhaust and pollution around his shop disappear. He is willing to pay you 200 gold pieces
 for every checkbox you complete or if you complete two checkboxes and correctly answer a Trivia question. You have an chance to win 
 600 gold pieces if you complete everything. </p>
