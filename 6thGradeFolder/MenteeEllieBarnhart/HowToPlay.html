     <p> Start by taking the Character Quiz. Once you have chosen a Race and a Class, a checklist of good deeds will pop up and they will help both the environment and also keep you in shape. For each checkbox, there is a monster. You will have an amount of time to complete the checkbox on the checklist. If you fail, the monster will take away the number of experience points that it has in hit Points. If you succeed, you will get a certain number of experience points.
once you have a certain number of experience points, a trivia question will pop up, based on what Class you chose. If you answer the trivia question correctly, you will get a number of experience points and be transported to the next level, without having to finish the previous level. If you answer it incorrectly, a number of experince points will be deducted and as the levels progress, the trivia questions will get harder and more experience points can be lost or gained. If you don't want to take the trivia question, you can select a "No" button, which will not take nor add experience points, but you will have to complete this level's checklist.
if you complete all 15 levels, and conquer all of the monsters, you will get an online certificate congradulating you and reminding you to be aware of helpingthe environment. Then, if you would like, you can start again with either the same or different character!
