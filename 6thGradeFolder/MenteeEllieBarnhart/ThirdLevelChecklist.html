    <p> In this level, you will be focusing on Recycling and giving to people. Recycling is wonderful for the environment because
 it can help reduce the amount of pollution in the environment.
 For this level's challenge, an established mayor is worried about the anual "Giving Back" ceremony that is in two days. She was
 supposed to show the people that she is qualified for the mayor by doing something that will help the world. She forgot and needs
 your help to save "Giving Back" day.  She is willing to pay you 300 gold pieces
 for every checkbox you complete or if you complete two checkboxes and correctly answer a Trivia question. You have an chance to win 
 900 gold pieces if you complete everything.</p>
